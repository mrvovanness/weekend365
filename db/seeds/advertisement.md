###Are employees leaving too soon?
Until now, doing surveys within your company meant you had to hire a consulting company, prepare a big budget and wait weeks for a report. It was hard to keep track of departments and individual employees. It was so much work that you would do it only one or two times an year. An unhappy talent donâ€™t want to wait that much to be heard.

Weekend Engagement made all that much easier to do. Just add your employees, do as many surveys you want and see the replies in real time. Compare with other companies of the same industry and follow our hints on how to solve problems.
